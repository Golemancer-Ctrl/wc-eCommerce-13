## Description
Through working on this assignment to this point, I have learned quite a bit about classes.  For instance, how a class might extend another class in order to be more efficient and modular.  I got to see working express routes in action, which complimented my previous interactions with Express.js in the prior assignments nicely, and continued working on databases.  Seeing the schema at work and building it out was an interesting experience, continuing our application of SQL.  Sequelize is a fascinating tool, allowing SQL to be directed through the use of JavaScript, increasing a project's efficiency.  In all, though I have not yet completed the assignment, interacting with it has informed me on several levels.
